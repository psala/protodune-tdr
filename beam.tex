\section{Charged particle beam properties}
\begin{itemize}
\item initial requirements from the measurement group: particles, energies, beam angles
\item hardware constraints in the beam line, matching with the cryo structure
\item final layout ( show figure ). Distance from target, magnetic elements, beam angles, positioning on cryostat and active voulme
\item particle spectra (simulations to be completed),  expected rates, expected beam dimensions (figure for particle spectra, figure or table for rates and dimensions. 
\item expected momentum uncertainty, possibility to reduce via collimation, influence on rates.  
\end{itemize}
